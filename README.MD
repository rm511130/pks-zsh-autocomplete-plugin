# [PKS](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service) CLI zsh autocomplete plugin

We use the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) custom plugin framework for [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) [autocompletion](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/blob/master/zsh-completions-howto.org) to enhance the PKS CLI experience with options for all its PKS commands.

# How will it work?

When, for example, you type `pks c` and then press `Tab` you will be offered the following choices to autocomplete your command:

```
cluster                 -- View the details of the cluster
clusters                -- Show all clusters created with PKS
create-cluster          -- Creates a kubernetes cluster, requires cluster na
create-network-profile  -- Create a network profile
create-sink             -- Creates a sink for sending all log data to syslog
```

Let's say you picked the `create-cluster` option and that you typed in the name `k8s-cluster`.

You should have `pks create-cluster k8s-cluster`. You then press `Tab` again to see additional choices:

```
--external-hostname  -- Address from which to access Kubernetes API
--help               -- help for create-cluster
--json               -- Return the PKS-API output as json
--network-profile    -- Optional, network profile name (NSX-T only)
--non-interactive    -- Dont ask for user input
--num-nodes          -- Number of worker nodes
--plan               -- Preconfigured plans. Run pks plans for more details
--wait               -- Wait for the operation to finish
```

If you select `--plan` and then press `Tab` again, you will be given a choice of plans created by your Ops Team. For example:

```
large   medium  small 
```

You can continue to press `Tab` for additional choices until you are satisfied with the complete command line at which point you will press `return` to execute the command.


## Installation

* Download the latest version of the [PKS CLI](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service)

* You also need [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/). The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with a large number of improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh. In June 2019, Apple announced that the forthcoming macOS Catalina (10.15) would adopt Zsh as the default shell, replacing Bash. How can you tell if you are running zsh?

```echo $SHELL```

If you are not using zsh, here's an example of how to install it.

* On a Mac, if you don't have zsh, you will need to execute the following command to install the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework: 

```sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/install-oh-my-zsh-MacOS)"```

* For other Operating Systems look for the oh-my-zsh framework installation instructions [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)


### Let's extend the Oh-My-Zsh framework with a custom PKS plugin:

* Clone this repo to your zsh custom plugins directory:

```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
git clone https://github.com/rm511130/pks-zsh-autocomplete-plugin.git pks
```

* Add the `pks` plugin to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
plugins=(... pks ...)
```

In my case, as an example, that part of the `~/.zshrc` file looks like this:

```
# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*
# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.

plugins=(git pks kubectl cloudfoundry)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

As you can see, the `pks` custom plugin has been added to the list.

* Additionally, in order to enable the oh-my-zsh autocompletion, append the following lines at the end of the same `~/.zshrc` file:

```
# enable autocomplete function
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

### Next Steps

* Make sure you start a new terminal window so that the changes described above take effect.

* Double check that you are using `zsh`

```
echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
```

* Try typing `pks` and then press the `Tab` key. You should see the following list of choices:

```
cluster                 -- View the details of the cluster
clusters                -- Show all clusters created with PKS
create-cluster          -- Creates a kubernetes cluster, requires cluster na
create-network-profile  -- Create a network profile
create-sink             -- Creates a sink for sending all log data to syslog
delete-cluster          -- Deletes a kubernetes cluster, requires cluster na
delete-network-profile  -- Delete a network profile
delete-sink             -- Deletes a sink from the given cluster
get-credentials         -- Allows you to connect to a cluster and use kubect
get-kubeconfig          -- Allows you to get kubeconfig for your username
help                    -- Help about any command
login                   -- Log in to PKS
logout                  -- Log out of PKS
network-profile         -- View a network profile
network-profiles        -- Show all network profiles created with PKS
plans                   -- View the preconfigured plans available
resize                  -- Changes the number of worker nodes for a cluster
sinks                   -- List sinks for the given cluster
update-cluster          -- Updates the configuration of a specific kubernete
upgrade-cluster         -- Upgrades the kubernetes clusters
```
